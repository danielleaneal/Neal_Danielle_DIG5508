# "A Computer Generated Randomized Hinge Poem"
# I am going to make a Processing Sketch in Python that will generate 
# a poem comprised of a random selection from a bank of responses 
# I received on the Hinge Dating App that describe what love is. This 
# project will hopefully run down the page of my processing document,
# with each line adding onto the poem.
