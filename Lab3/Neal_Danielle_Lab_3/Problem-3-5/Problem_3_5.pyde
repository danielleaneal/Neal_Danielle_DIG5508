#3-5


# I'm unable to get my dogs and drawings to run in the same frame, so I don't really know
# I can make two objects coexist in the same box. In 3-4, I attempted to make the drawing object work
# over top of my dog class, but could only get them to work separately. Also, the keyboard press
# function in 3-2 never yielded any sort of outcome, so I really don't know how I'd even begin to work
# this problem.
