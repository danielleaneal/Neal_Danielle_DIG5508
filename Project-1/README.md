For "Free Project 1,"I initially tried to do Free Project 7-3 in the textbook and create a program that printed the words
"Everything is okay" an infinite number of times. I believe I accomplished this the first time around, but I was worried that this was 
not what the 7-3 free project was asking for. Thus, I moved on to Free Project 7-3, which felt more similar to the madlibs exercise
in class, or the first day's activity with "Perverbs." I used python to change the items within each list, and then I utilized the 
"if" function to change the phrases that could potentially end up being grammatically incorrect. In the end, I came up with some pretty 
interesting outputs with my program.
